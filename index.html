        About Me
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal website! I am excited to share pertinent details about the work I've accomplished and personal interests.
        I am a budding data scientist, majoring in Applied Analytics at the renowned engineering university the Illinois Institute of Technology. My motto is <span>Applied Machine Learning and Practical Data Science</span>
        because I believe strongly that a sophisticated mathematical model is only as useful as its functional applied use in industry. Too often, researchers can become so
        enthralled in the nitty gritty of their model, that they neglect to consider their project's usefulness to shareholders and non-statisticians. I take the opposite approach in
        data science. 
      </p>
      <p>Tools should be deployed first and refined later. In my experience, the true work of the data science project is in data collection, curation, and communication.
        When I ran an e-commerce site with my friend, I wanted to know which customers clicked through and ultimately purchased a product. My initial question was not <i>what model will I use?</i>
        Rather, I begin asking what do our domain experts in sales and
        marketing understand about our customers' behavior? How do we communicate these results with our bosses? How will we collect this data? Where will it be stored? How will we authenticate the integrity of this data? When you cover your foundation, your structure is stable.
        There is accountability in every step, and the project will likely be completed on time and under-budget. I take a holistic and broad approach to my work.
      </p>
      <p>David Epstein in his recent book <span>Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</span> defended the idea that work succeeds when you are open minded, think outside the box,
        and optimize your workflow for versatility rather than specialization. Though I am a numbers guy at heart, I have an insatiable appetite for knowledge outside my
        area of expertise. I hope this website best conveys this message in your browsing. Thank you!

      <p >
        Though I'm a Chicagoan, I was actually born in sunny California and moved here in 2011. Living at the epicenter of media and Hollywood, I originally had dreams of 
        being a journalist or movie actor. I am a Bardolator; I love reading and performing Shakespeare in my free time. I'm an ambivert, though I would often prefer
        reading in a coffee shop. I love travelling.
      </p>
      <p>I've been to 
        11 countries so far. The picture on the left is from my recent trip to Cambodia! I love learning about other cultures and studying a new language. Currently I'm taking Russian on the Duolingo app. 
        My parents are proud immigrants from Mexico. They came to this country to provide a better life for their children. For this, I am proud
        of my Latinx heritage. I am a member of the Latinx club on campus -- participating in cultural enrichment events and supporting fellow 
        latinos in STEM. 
      </p>
      <p>Diversity and inclusivity are two of my core values. I cherish interdisciplinary working enviornments, and I find that
        the best teams are often diverse. I hope in the future to be a mentor to impovrished latino youth, so that they can 
        aspire to work in a field as rigorous as computer science. 
      </p>
