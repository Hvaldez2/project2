        The Future of Urban Planning
		  </h2>
        <p class="pblog">Entrepreneurism and capitalism are the hallmarks of the American lifestyle. But building a
          start-up from scratch is a daunting prospect even for the most savy business people. I was honored to be accepted in the 
          2 day start-up challenge hosted by the Chicago tech incubator, <i>1871</i>. I came in as a shy computer science nerd
          and came out with renewed confidence in my ability to build an innovative solution alongside great minds with expertise in business,
          finance, and computer science. Throughout the weekend, I was able to appreciate the countless lessons and long hours devoted to
          building this company. I thank my teammates and 1871 for the tremendous weekend and look forward to whatever entrepreneurial opportunities
          are afforded in the future! This is <i>Restructure.</i>

          City planning is a long and arduous process involving the collaboration of countless stakeholders from high level politicians, to the
          everyday construction worker. That process, however, is often so time consuming that projects almost always go over-budget and behind schedule.
          With the advent of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science, we can optimize the city's ability to
          tackle common infrastructure problems efficiently and even predict when future work will occur! Throughout the brainstorming process,
          it's important to understand the needs of every domain. I listened attently at my teammates, such as Business major Joshua York, Finance major Gabriel Soler,
          and Entrepreneurship major James Pickard as they enlightened us on the value of good pitches, scalable solutions, and
          business needs. Collaborating with other computer science majors like Tommi Li and Ashwini Naik we were able to
          combine our range of expertise from data analysis, design, and coding to  build our final product. Our final product would not have been possible
          without this interdisciplinary outside-the-box thinking. Too often people identify themselves as a specialized worker whos work involves 
          a single expertise and not much else. But in today's economy, modern workers require modern skills in almost all aspects of white collar work. 
          If you don't have that expertise, it's imperative to find someone who does to fill in the gaps.

        </div>
        <p class="pblog">There are countless life lessons learned throughout this weekend. Although winning second place in a country-wide 
          contest is fun, I will never forget the feeling of awe and accomplishment in the work done to get that final product. 
          There were moments where the team was stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is so easy to feel defeated, to just give up.
          But perseverance and grit will take you a long way. You just have to keep pressing forward. Seek advice from people who know more than you, 
          research new and novel methods online, or going back to the drawing board and clarifying the foundation of the project.
          These skills will be indispensible throughout my professional career, whether I decide to work in a start-up or a more
          established company. Thank you again to all my teammates and I hope to work with you all again someday!
